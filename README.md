Java must be installed in order to run the compiler
### CLI
#### Compiling 
1. Download the latest release of the compiler from [here](https://github.com/Its-Jakey/SCPP/releases)
2. to compile your file run

    java -jar SCPP.jar -i {[INPUT_FILE] -o [OUTPUT_FILE.txt]\(optional)} or {-t (to compile all examples)}, use "-r" to run the program in the emulator
### IDE
1. Run the jarfile without arguments to open the IDE
2. Create a new project or open an existing project
3. Click 'run' on the menu bar, or press F5 to run the program
#### Running
To run your file, goto the [VM](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/697633215/editor/) Scratch project, then right-click the "program" list and hit the "import" button then select your file. You can then click the flag to run the program.
